# FastMultiplier

The Fast Multiplier is a large-scale integration layout project using a magic layout.
The multiplying method is the Wallace tree method for efficient binary multiplication, reducing partial products, and optimizing addition via a structured tree approach. This minimizes critical path delay, enhancing performance compared to traditional algorithms, particularly with large operands.
